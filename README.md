This repository contains an implementation of Pascal's Triangle in Python.
# Pascal's Triangle

## Overview

This Python project implements a function to generate Pascal's Triangle of a specified size. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept that is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it. The first and last elements of each row are always 1.

## Task

The task is to create a Python function `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascalâ€™s triangle of size `n`. The function should adhere to the following requirements:

- Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`.
- Assumes `n` will always be an integer.

## Example

For example, calling `pascal_triangle(5)` should produce the following output:
